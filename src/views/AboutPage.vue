					<div class="value">
						<h3 class="value__head">
							We take responsibilty for ourselves
						</h3>
						<p class="value__desc">
							At Kijivu, we believe that being responsible means
							taking care of our actions and making good choices.
							Just like how superheroes take care of their city,

						<h3 class="value__head">We show compassion</h3>
						<p class="value__desc">
							Compassion is about being kind and understanding how
							others feel. At Kijivu, we create stories and videos
							that show how important it is to be nice and help
							each other. It's like sharing your toys or giving a
							hug when someone is sadâ€”it makes the world a better
							place.

					<div class="value">
						<h3 class="value__head">We Nurture curiosity</h3>
						<p class="value__desc">
							Curiosity is like being a little detective who loves
							to learn new things. We make fun videos and stories
							that make you want to ask questions and explore.
							It's like going on a treasure hunt where every clue
							leads to something amazing to learn.
