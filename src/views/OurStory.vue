					<p class="founder1__story">
						Mama Dolfine was a government-employed teacher for 20
						years until she lost her 14 and 27 year old sons in 1996
						within just one year. This very traumatizing experience
						brought her to depression followed by a premature
						retirement. As she was staying at home, she started
						taking care of the first five orphans Miskela, Lucy,
						Isiah, Brenda and Kennedy; that gave a new meaning to
						her life. More of them started coming, finding shelter
						and care with her, but also food and financial support
						to be send to public school. In 2006 she opened her own
						non-formal school to accommodate even more children and
						reduce the increasing cost of school fees. Her husband
						Patrick became the headteacher of the new school and
						supported her greatly throughout the years. Then in 2014
						she had to handle another huge loss when her husband
						Patrick passed away. Though life left it’s scars, it
						didn’t stop her. And today, at 69 years old, she keeps
						on struggling for those children in need and must have
						changed over 1000 lives already.

					<p class="founder2__story">
						Toto, a well travelled globetrotter and visionary
						entrepreneur, had discovered the Korando Educational
						Center, near Kisumu, Kenya, in 2012 during his first
						journey through eastern and southern Africa. By absolute
						coincidence (or destiny) he met Mama Dolfine, a Kenyan
						woman who, at 64, keeps on giving all her time and
						energy to provide food, shelter, healthcare and
						education to the orphans, vulnerable children and widows
						of her local community. Her devoted commitment touched
						his heart and he was able to raise small funds
						immediately to build a new classroom, showers, buy two
						dozen chickens and a computer. His time was limited and
						so he had to leave after just 7 days. But Mama and the
						children stayed in his heart and he promised himself to
						return. And so he did. In January 2015 he made his
						promise come true. Together with his good friend
						Mathilde he started a long 5200km journey from South
						Africa to Kenya, crossing Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi,
						Tanzania and Uganda on their way, to raise awareness but
						also funds for the Korando Educational Center. What
						started as a simple idea to help Mama Dolfine and her
						children, turned into a big vision then called Cheap
						Trip Big Impact. Later the vision evolved into the
						Better Me Foundation and Torsten, his team and the
						volunteers are working tirelessly to turn its
						ever-expanding vision into reality. This transparent and
						rapidly growing grassroots organization is aiming for
						nothing less than the stars and you can be part of this
						journey!
