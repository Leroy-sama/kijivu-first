					In our mission to unleash children & youth, education is
					fundamental. We believe that children should have the power
					to read and write, to understand the basics of science,
					math, biology and the functioning of society, to speak
					different languages and to discipline the mind.
				</p>
				<p class="education__text2">
					For this, we provide vulnerable children with access to
					primary and high-school education.
